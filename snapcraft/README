This folder contains an experimental attempt to build a snap package for nikola.

To build, in Ubuntu 16.04:

apt install snapd snapcraft
snap login some.account@whatever.com
snapcraft
cp nikola.py stage/usr/bin/nikola
snapcraft
snap install nikola*snap --devmode

See that --devmode there? That makes Nikola run unconfined, giving it access
to all your files. That sounds bad, but it's the same way you have run it
in the past.



To just use it:

apt install snapd snapcraft
snap login some.account@whatever.com
snap install nikola --devmode


That should leave you with a woring "nikola" command, which is functional with the 
following caveats:

* Locales are broken: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/+bug/1576411
* The -b option in nikola serve and nikola auto will not work (need to use snap-xdg-open it seems)
* Plugin installation is tricky
* Probaby other things I have not noticed yet.

Additionally, if used on strict mode:

* Your site needs to live in ~/snaps/nikola/x1/whatever (the x1 may change)
* If you uninstall nikola it will kill your site ;-)
* You can't use "nikola deploy".
