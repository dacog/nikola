This folder contains an experimental attempt to build a snap package for nikola.

To build, in Ubuntu 16.04:

apt install snapd snapcraft
snap login some.account@whatever.com
snapcraft
snapd install nikola*snap --devmode

To just use it:

apt install snapd snapcraft
snap login some.account@whatever.com
snap install nikola


That should leave you with a woring "nikola" command, which is functional with the 
following caveats:

* Locales are broken: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/+bug/1576411
* It needs to run in devmode (unconfined). I am not sure it makes much sense to
  try to use it otherwise, and in any case it doesn't work for a variety of bugs.
* The -b option in nikola serve and nikola auto will not work
* Probaby other things I have not noticed yet.
